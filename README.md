## JSModMenu.lua

### Steps to Run the Script

1. **Save the Script**:
   - Copy the **JSModMenu** code and paste it into a text editor, like Notepad.
   - Save the file with a `.lua` extension, for example, `JSModMenu.lua`.

2. **Add the Script to Kiddion’s Modest Menu or Yim Menu**:
   - If you’re using **Kiddion's Modest Menu**:
     - Place the `JSModMenu.lua` file in the `scripts` folder inside the Kiddion’s Modest Menu directory. If the `scripts` folder doesn’t exist, create it.
   - If you’re using **Yim Menu** with YimStuff:
     - Save the file in the designated location according to Yim Menu’s instructions (usually in a similar scripts folder).

3. **Load the Script in the Menu**:
   - Open **Kiddion's Modest Menu** or **Yim Menu** in GTA V.
   - In the menu, go to the script section (in Kiddion’s: “Lua Scripts”).
   - You should see `JSModMenu` listed. Select it to load and activate the menu.

4. **Check in the Game**:
   - The menu should now appear in-game. Navigate through options, like **Invincibility** or **Teleport**, to confirm that the script works.

### Notes

- **Updating and Testing**: Each time you modify the script, save the file and reload it in the menu.
- **Script Errors**: Make sure both GTA V and Kiddion's/Yim Menu are up to date, as compatibility with commands may vary across versions.
